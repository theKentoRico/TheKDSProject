# Welcome to KDS.
## What is KDS
KDS is a hobby language started by... me, yeah just me.
## Installing KDS
Currently, KDS has no prebuilt binaries so you'll have to build it from source.
There's 2 ways to do it:
### With GNU Make
Requirements:
    g++
    ld
    make // Obviously //
How to: Enter `$ make` in bash.
### With other generators
Requirements:
    cmake
How to: Enter `$ cmake --build .` in bash.
