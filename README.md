# Welcome to KDS.

## What is KDS

KDS is a hobby language started by... me, yeah just me.
## Installing KDS

Currently, KDS has no prebuilt binaries so you'll have to build it from source.
There's 3 ways to do it:
### With GNU Make

Requirements:
    g++

    ld

    nasm

    make

How to: Enter `$ make` in bash.
### With Visual Studio 2022

How to: Enter `> devenv ./build_systems/vs2022` in VsDevCmd.bat and build.

### With other generators

Requirements:
    cmake
    
    nasm

How to: Enter `$ cmake --build .` in bash.
